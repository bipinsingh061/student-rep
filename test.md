NewsQA is a question answering dataset focused on news articles. It consists of 128,832 human-annotated question-answer pairs. The dataset covers a wide range of news topics, including politics, business, technology, entertainment, and sports. The questions are often complex and require inference and multi-hop reasoning. NewsQA was developed by researchers at Facebook AI Research and was first released in 2017. It has since become a popular benchmark for evaluating question answering systems. The dataset is challenging, but it is also well-annotated and provides a rich source of data for training and evaluating models. In addition to the main dataset, NewsQA also includes a development set and a test set. The development set is used for tuning model parameters and the test set is used for final evaluation. The dataset is available for download from the NewsQA website. NewsQA has been used to train and evaluate a variety of question answering systems. Some of the best-performing systems have been able to achieve an accuracy of over 70% on the test set. However, there is still room for improvement, and NewsQA remains a challenging dataset for question answering systems. Here are some of the key features of NewsQA: * **Large and diverse:** NewsQA consists of 128,832 human-annotated question-answer pairs, covering a wide range of news topics. * **Complex questions:** The questions in NewsQA are often complex and require inference and multi-hop reasoning. * **Well-annotated:** The dataset is well-annotated, with each question-answer pair carefully reviewed by human annotators. * **Challenging:** NewsQA is a challenging dataset for question answering systems, but it is also a valuable resource for training and evaluating models. NewsQA has been influential in the development of question answering systems. It has helped to advance the state-of-the-art and has inspired new research directions. The dataset is likely to continue to be a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field of natural language processing.
